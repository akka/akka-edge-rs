//! An event sourced entity (also known as a persistent entity) receives a (non-persistent) command which is first validated
//! if it can be applied to the current state. Here validation can mean anything, from simple inspection of a command messageâ€™s
//! fields up to a conversation with several external services, for example. If validation succeeds, events are generated
//! from the command, representing the effect of the command. These events are then persisted and, after successful persistence,
//! used to change the entity's state. When the event sourced actor needs to be recovered, only the persisted events are replayed
//! of which we know that they can be successfully applied. In other words, events cannot fail when being replayed to a persistent
//! entity, in contrast to commands. Event sourced entities may also process commands that do not change application state such
//! as query commands for example.
