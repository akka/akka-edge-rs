# Akka Edge Rust

*Extending the power of Akkaâ€™s event-driven model to resource-constrained devices.*

Akka Edge support in Rust is designed to empower cloud developers at the edge. Akka Edge brings familiar concepts to developers familiar with Akka when used elsewhere, while simultaneously recognizing the resource constraints present at the edge.

## Documentation

The Akka documentation is available at [https://akka.io/docs/](akka.io/docs).

The Akka Edge guides are found via [akka.io/edge](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-edge/current/guide-rs.html).
The reference documentation is part of the [Akka Edge Rust API docs](https://doc.akka.io/api/akka-edge-rs/current/).

## Current versions of all Akka libraries

The current versions of all Akka libraries are listed on the [Akka Dependencies](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-dependencies/current/) page. Releases of the Akka Edge Rust libraries in this repository are listed on the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/akka/akka-edge-rs/releases) page.

Akka Edge Rust is currently [Incubating](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-dependencies/current/support-terminology.html#incubating), and we are eager for your feedback.

### Minimum supported Rust

This library requires a minimum of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version 1.70.0 stable (June 2023), but the current stable version of Rust is recommended.

## Akka

[Akka](https://akka.io/) facilitates the building of [Reactive Systems](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) with a particular emphasis on resilience and responsiveness. 
Resilience is achieved by being able to recover in the face of, say, an internet connection failing, and being able to continue local-first operations. Responsiveness is achieved primarily through being event-driven. As events occur at the edge, they can be pushed to the cloud, to the user, and other parts of the edge-based system - at the time they occur.

The Akka family of projects is managed by teams at [Lightbend](https://lightbend.com) with help from the community.
